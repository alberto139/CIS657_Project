# CIS657_Project

This is our final project for CIS 657 Principles of Operating Systems.
Authors: Alberto Rivera, Nabid Nieves and Roy Puli.

The project consist of using page replacement algorithms, which are common in operating systems, to keep track and replace
neighbors in a neighborhood of swarm robots. The code is designed to run on our Antz robots which are powered by an Arduino
Mega microcontroller.
